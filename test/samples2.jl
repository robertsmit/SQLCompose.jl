#1a. You need a list of all the actorsâ€™ first name and last name
@testsql map(Pagila.Actor, :first_name, :last_name),
"SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name FROM actor a"
#1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name
@testsql map(Pagila.Actor) do a
   a.first_name * " " * a.last_name
end,
"SELECT CONCAT(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) AS elem1 FROM actor a"

#2a. You need to find the id, first name, and last name of an actor of whom you know only the first name of "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
@testsql (@query Pagila.Actor begin
   filter(a -> a.first_name == "JOE", _)
   map(_, :actor_id, :first_name, :last_name)
end), "SELECT a.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name FROM actor a WHERE a.first_name = 'JOE'"

#2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN. Make this case insensitive
@testsql (@query Pagila.Actor begin
   filter(a -> a.first_name == like"JOE", _)
   map(_, :actor_id, :first_name, :last_name)
end), "SELECT a.actor_id, a.first_name, a.last_name FROM actor a WHERE a.first_name LIKE 'JOE'"

#2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
@testsql Pagila.Country |>
         filter(c -> c.country in ["Afghanistan", "Bangladesh", "China"]),
"  SELECT c.country_id, c.country, c.last_update 
   FROM country c 
   WHERE c.country IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China')"

#4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
@testsql (@query Pagila.Actor begin
   groupby(_, :last_name)
   map(a -> (; a.last_name, count=count(a.last_name)), _)
end),"
   SELECT a.last_name, count(a.last_name) AS count 
   FROM actor a 
   GROUP BY a.last_name"

#4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors
@testsql (@query Pagila.Actor begin
   groupby(_, :last_name)
   map(a -> (; a.last_name, count=count(a.last_name)), _)
   having(a -> a.count > 1, _)
end),"
   SELECT a.last_name, count(a.last_name) AS count 
   FROM actor a 
   GROUP BY a.last_name
   HAVING count(a.last_name) > 1"
