# SQLCompose.jl

*SQLCompose implements the compositional construction of SQL queries.*

[![Documentation][docs-rel-img]][docs-rel-url]

## Overview

The goal of this package is to use julia's means of abstraction to built SQL queries.
The SQL language has no good built-in abstraction methods. By using julia methods for abstraction it
is such easier to built complex queries.

Also retrieving the data of the queried julia structure is supported.
